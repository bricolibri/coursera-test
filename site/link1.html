	<p class="highlight"> The land is reawakening with the swelling of tree buds and the climbing sun. Green saturates grey, and levity tickles at the corners of his eyes.
He harkens a sweet relief of burgeoning hope after a dark season, as the composting stories of yesterday now nourish the sprouting seeds of today’s intentions to bring fruit in the seasons to come.

<p>He is the steadfast and faithful masculine who upholds the endless cycle of slumber and awakening, birth, life, death, and rebirth. While aged and wise, he exudes a playful sensuality and mischievous lightheartedness. He tends to the wild and fertile feminine, and together they spiral in an eternal dance of unbridled creation, timely decay, and graceful rebirth.</p>
